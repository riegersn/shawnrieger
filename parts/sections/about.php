    <p>Hi, I'm Shawn.</p>
    <p>Father. Husband. Impassioned developer with a hearty appetite for learning new things. Born in Texas, grew up in South Jersey. Received my AAS in Computer Information Systems at Camden County College. When I'm not coding I'm spending time with my wife and <span class="collinAge">5</span> year old son.</p>
    <p>Intrigued by photography, woodworking, and drawing. Enjoy fall and winter hiking on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batona_Trail">Batona trail</a>, a 53 mile hiking trail through the Jersey Pine Barrens and others.</p>
    <p>If I wasn't a developer? I'd do something with my hands, be my own boss. A handyman most likely. I have a knack for fixing just about anything. Youtube has saved me thousands of dollars over the years.</p>
    <p>Got the bug for development in the mid-90's. You know... <a href="#">Juno</a>, <a href="#">CompuServe</a>, <a href="#">America Online</a>. Teaching myself <a href="#">Visual Basic</a>, I developed an "auto re-dialer" for AOL utilizing <a href="#">SendKeys</a>, the line was always busy in the evenings. It's difficult to describe what I felt back then. Enchanted, amazed, filled with wonder and curiosity.</p>
    <p>I still feel that curiosity today. It's one of the things that drives me to continue coding and learning new things.</p>
