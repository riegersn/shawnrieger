    <p>I started my career in the tech field working for <a href="#">Commerce Bank</a> and <a href="#">TD Bank NA</a> as an IT Help Desk agent. I got my foot in the door but it wasn't my passion. I continued coding in VB6 on the side for fun until early 2009, I discovered the small startup <a href="#">Boxee</a>.</p>
    <p>Boxee was a desktop "media-center" software turned set-top device based off <a href="#">XBMC</a>, currating video content from around the web. Their software supported building applications using XUL and Python. I quickly built a PBS and GameTrailers app. Threw up <a href="#">BoxeeHQ.com</a> to host my applications in a repository.</p>
    <p>Come mid-June of 09, my apps where gaining traction with the community, when I received a email from the Boxee guys about my work. I joined the Boxee team and continued to write apps for the platform over the next 4 years.</p>
